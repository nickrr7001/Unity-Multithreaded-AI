# Unity-Multithreaded-AI
An example of an efficient basic multi threading (Unity Jobs) AI system in Unity.
This is part of a much larger comericial project so therefore the code references content that isn't included.
Said content most likely won't be added as it is for a comercial project, however this should serve more as
a starting reference for projects that need AI to be quick (specifically for AI vision).
